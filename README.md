In this repo you will find several templates to get you started with various integrations with Less in different programming languages.

In all of the examples you can expect the following:
1. The integrations will be created as shared modules (in the `/less/shared` folder), allowing them to be easily copied and used in your own projects.
2. There will be a `GET /hello/{LANGUAGE}` (e.g. GET /hello/py) route for each programming language (in the `/less/apis/demo/hello` folder).
